Using these commands, I removed execute permission for everybody:
$ chmod r-x _ex3.txt
$ chmod u-x _ex3.txt
$ chmod g-x _ex3.txt

A  numeric  mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits
are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted  deletion  or
sticky  (1)  attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute
(1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth  for  other  users
not in the file's group, with the same values.

chmod  never  changes  the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on  the  command  line,
chmod  changes  the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive
directory traversals.

Using the command:
$ chmod 707 _ex3.txt
I give all permissions to everyone except group.

660 means give permission to read and write to owner and group
775 means give the owner and the group all permissions and world read and execute
777 means give everyone all permissions
