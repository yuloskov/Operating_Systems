I created file.txt in week01 directory.
Then, using this command:
$ link ../week01/file.txt _ex2.txt 
I linked it to _ex2.txt.
Using this command: 
$ ls -i ../week01/file.txt
I got the node number and used it to find links:
$ find ../week01/file.txt -inum 4334936
Then I deleted hard links with this command:
$ find ../week01/file.txt -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 rm -v {}
And got a message: removed '../week01/file.txt'
